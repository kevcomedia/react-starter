# react-starter

My starter repo for React projects.

I don't know if this starter is good enough, and as of this writing this starter
is hacked together by skimming through the webpack guide and the eslint docs.
There could be stuff that I left out, so things will probably break.

I wouldn't be able to put this together without looking at @Kornil's
[`simple-react-app`](https://github.com/Kornil/simple-react-app). It's more
likely a better starter repo than mine, so it's worth checking it out.

## Getting started

1. Download this repo.
2. Run `npm install`. I've never used yarn, so I'm not sure.
3. Run `npm start` to start the webpack-dev-server. You can then open the app
at `localhost:8080`.
4. Make something!
